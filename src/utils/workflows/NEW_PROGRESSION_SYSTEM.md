# New Gameable Progression System

## Overview

The new progression system replaces the confusing 5-stage system with a clear, intuitive level-based progression that makes sense to users and provides genuine gamification elements.

## Why We Changed the System

### Problems with the Old System:

1. **Confusing Names**: "Level 2", "Dynamic", "Smart Path" were unclear
2. **Arbitrary Requirements**: Requirements like "15+ actions" felt random
3. **No Clear Value**: Users didn't understand what each stage unlocked
4. **Poor Gamification**: Missing core gaming elements like clear progression
5. **Complex Skill Trees**: Overly complicated skill path system

### Benefits of the New System:

1. **Clear Progression**: Intuitive level names that users understand
2. **Meaningful Requirements**: Requirements tied to actual financial behaviors
3. **Clear Rewards**: Each level unlocks specific, valuable features
4. **Proper Gamification**: XP, levels, badges, and clear progression
5. **Simplified**: Removes unnecessary complexity
