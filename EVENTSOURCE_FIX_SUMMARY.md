# EventSource Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **React Native EventSource Missing**: React Native doesn't have native EventSource support
2. **Polyfill in Wrong Location**: Polyfill files were in `app/polyfills/` which Expo Router treats as routes
3. **Missing Auth Headers**: Fallback requests weren't including authentication headers
4. **Missing Default Export**: MissingInfoCard.tsx was missing default export

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Proper Polyfill Structure

- **Created**: `src/polyfills/eventsource.native.ts` - React Native polyfill using react-native-sse
- **Created**: `src/polyfills/eventsource.web.ts` - Web placeholder (browser has native EventSource)
- **Created**: `src/polyfills/index.ts` - Platform-specific polyfill loader
- **Created**: `index.ts` - Root entry point that loads polyfill before expo-router

### 2. Updated Package Configuration

- **Modified**: `package.json` - Changed main entry from "expo-router/entry" to "index.ts"

### 3. Fixed EnhancedStreamingService

- **Modified**: `src/services/feature/enhancedStreamingService.ts`
  - Updated to use `(global as any).EventSource` instead of direct `EventSource`
  - Added proper auth header handling for both SSE and fallback requests
  - Added `fetchNonStreaming` function for proper fallback with auth headers

### 4. Cleaned Up Old Files

- **Deleted**: `app/polyfills/eventsource.web.ts` - Wrong location
- **Deleted**: `src/bootstrap/eventsource.*.ts` - Old polyfill files
- **Modified**: `app/_layout.tsx` - Removed old polyfill imports

### 5. Fixed Component Export

- **Modified**: `src/components/assistant/MissingInfoCard.tsx` - Added default export

## How It Works

1. **App Startup**: `index.ts` loads polyfills before expo-router
2. **Platform Detection**: Polyfill loader detects platform and loads appropriate EventSource implementation
3. **Global Assignment**: React Native gets `react-native-sse` EventSource assigned to `global.EventSource`
4. **Service Usage**: EnhancedStreamingService uses `(global as any).EventSource` for cross-platform compatibility
5. **Auth Headers**: Both SSE and fallback requests include proper authentication headers

## Testing

Run the test file in React Native debugger console:

```javascript
// In React Native debugger console
console.log('global.EventSource exists:', !!global.EventSource);
```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Start the app; in JS console run: `!!global.EventSource` â†’ should return `true`
- [ ] Hit SSE endpoint; should see "SSE open/message" logs and tokens streaming
- [ ] If SSE fails, fallback should POST with `x-firebase-uid` present (check server logs)
- [ ] No more "missing default export" warnings for MissingInfoCard
- [ ] No more "Route missing required default export" warnings for polyfills

## Platform Notes

- **iOS Simulator**: Use `http://localhost:3000` for API base
- **Android Emulator**: Use `http://10.0.2.2:3000` for API base
- **Web**: Uses native browser EventSource (no polyfill needed)
