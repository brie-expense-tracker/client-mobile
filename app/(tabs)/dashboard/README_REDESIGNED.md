## How to Use

1. **Replace the current dashboard**: Rename `index.tsx` to `index.original.tsx` and rename `index.redesigned.tsx` to `index.tsx`

2. **Test the new features**:
   - Pull to refresh works
   - Quick actions navigate to correct screens
   - Sparkline updates with real transaction data
   - All navigation routes are properly configured

## Dependencies

The redesigned dashboard uses these existing dependencies:

- `expo-linear-gradient` (already installed)
- `react-native-svg` (already installed)

## Navigation Routes

All navigation routes have been updated to match the app's routing structure:

- Income: `/(tabs)/transaction?mode=income`
- Expense: `/(tabs)/transaction?mode=expense`
- Goals: `/(tabs)/budgets?tab=goals`
- Recurring: `/(tabs)/budgets?tab=recurring`
- Transaction Details: `/dashboard/ledger/edit?id={id}`

## Performance Notes

- Sparkline uses lightweight SVG (no heavy chart libraries)
- Progress bars use simple Views (no complex animations)
- Shadows use low elevation for Android performance
- Proper memoization for calculated values

## Accessibility

- All interactive elements have proper accessibility labels
- Uses the existing `accessibilityProps` and `dynamicTextStyle` utilities
- Proper touch targets and contrast ratios
- Screen reader friendly

## Future Enhancements

The code includes placeholders for:

- Real recurring expenses data (currently shows mock data)
- Haptic feedback on quick actions
- Animated balance number changes
- Pulsing notification badge animations

To implement these, you would need to:

1. Connect to your recurring expenses context
2. Add `expo-haptics` for haptic feedback
3. Implement count-up animations for balance changes
4. Add pulse animations for notification badges
